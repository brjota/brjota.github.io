I first got involved in the Information Security in 2016 when I got Security+ certified. After a 2 year hiatus I was fortunate enough to attend a SANS workshop for SEC560 and earned my GPEN. I've been trying to play catch up ever since. 

Between work, CTFs, going through training courses, and working through an extensive list of milestones I'd like to accomplish I need another 6 hours in my day. And more caffeine.
